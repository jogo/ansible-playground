Base
=========

Set up my preferred base environment.

Requirements
------------

None


Role Variables
--------------

* `upgrade`

If `true` upgrade all packages first. Defaults to `true`

Dependencies
------------

None


Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - role: base
           upgrade: false
